<p>Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system.<br> It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.<br>Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably. <br>But, more accurately, global warming is the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures <br>and its projected continuation, while climate change includes both global warming and its effects,<br> such as changes in precipitation. <br>While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia.</p>
